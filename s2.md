LIMS-S2
=======

Overview
--------
The Sanger *LIMS* project is a web-based Laboratory Information Management System composed of applications and modules written mainly in *Ruby* and *JavaScript*. The front end are *Javascript*  application accessing one (or more) *Ruby* server.

*S2* refers to the main server application and its components. This document is about *S2* (and *S2* only).
Those components (*Ruby gem*) are the building block of *LIMS* and are reused in different application.

All the code is open source and can be found on [*Github*](http://github.com/sanger) under the *Sanger* organization.

### Components
*S2* is composed of 3 gems:

+ `lims-core` : [github](http/github.com/sanger/lims-core)
Database access and general classes/modules.

+ `lims-api` : [github](http/github.com/sanger/lims-api)
Web API related , Web server JSON encoders/decoders.
Depends on `lims-core`

+ `lims-laboratory` : [github](http/github.com/sanger/lims-laboratory)
Business domain: Plate, Order etc ...
Depends on `lims-core` and `lims-api`.

### Dependencies
*S2* is based on the following gems:

+ `Virtus`  : allows attributes definitions
+ `Sequel` : access to the database.
+ `Aequitas` : Validation of `Virtus` object.
+ `Sinatra` : for the web server side.
+ `MQRabbit` : for the message queue.

*Virtus* and *Aequitas* come from *datamapper2*. When the project started *datamapper2* wasn't finished it yet, which is why *S2* is including is own ORM. *datamapper2* has evolved since, but introduce some incompatibilities especially in the *Virtus*-*Aequitas* bridge making any update difficult. In the future it would be nice to either migrate to the new version of *datamapper2*, or remove the dependencies.

Design and General Concepts (how to use it)
---------------
*S2* is the back end for client based applications, even though it's an *HTTP* server it's not a web application (or an web application) as such and doens't follow the popular MVC pattern or equivalent.
The goal of *S2* is to manage and *persist* business specific **resources** via an HTTP *API*.
This splits naturally in 3 components:
+ the business domain: in our case the *LIMS* classes
+ a persistence mechanism 
+ an api layer responsible to encode/decode resources.
Those 3 components correspond roughly to 3 ruby gems, respectively : `lims-laboratory-app`, `lims-core`, `lims-api`.
The base gems (`lims-core` and `lims-api`) are generic gems and could be used to build any **resources HTTP server**.

#### Design Principles
The main principles behind *S2* design are:
- The domain model should be written without any knowledge (or dependency) of the persistence layer, this is called *Persistence Agnosticism* or *Persistence Ignorance*.
This leads to the concept of `Resource` and `Session`.
- Complex business logic should stay within *S2* and not be written within the client.
This leads to the concept of `Action`.
- The internal database schema should be hidden and only top level resources should be exposed via the *API*.
This leads to the concept of `Uuid`.
- The API should be self-explanatory.

#### Main Classes
The main classes are :
+ `Lims::Core::Resources`  : Top level entities. They can be saved and loaded from a `Store` and converted into *JSON* via `Encoder`/`Decoder`.
+ `Lims::Core::Store` : A persistent **data store**, were resources can be saved.
+ `Lims::Core::Session` : in charge of loading/saving object.
+ `Lims::Core::Persistor` : implements the persistence of a resource.
+ `Lims::Core::Action` : high level set of modifications on element of the business domain.
+ `Lims::Api::Context` : holds information corresponding to the current execution of a server request.
+ `Lims::Api::Resource` : something exposed through the *API*
+ `Lims::Api::CoreResource` : an `Api::Resource` referencing a `Core::Resource`
+ `Lims::Api::Resource::Encoder` : encodes a resource to the required format.
+ `Lims::Api::Resource::Decoder` : decodes 

 

#### API
The *API* provide RESTful way to access and store data. The current implementation only process and return *JSON* but `lims-api` could be extended easily to support other format.
It gives (as much as possible) a consistent output whatever resource or service are called, which is a hash with one entry, being the type of the resource/service required.

The *API* should be self-explanatory, meaning the user shouldn't have to guess *URL*.
For this purpose each response contains a special `actions` which list all the available actions and their corresponding url.
The users are strongly recommanded to **follow** those *URL* instead of making them up themselve. This should allow url to be renamed without having to modify the client code.

The idea behind was that different actions (like read or update)  could be processed on different servers and so have different URLs. This has been made obsolete by the use of the `lims-bridge-app` which intercept and rewrite *JSON* between the client and the server.

#### Uuid
All top level **resources** have an unique identifiant, a *UUID*. A resource can be accessed directly via this `/<uuid>`.
#### Mime-Type and Views
By default, all response are **expanded**. They include all embedded resources in the same format as it would be display on its own page.
For example, a list of plates will expand each plates, which in turn will expand each samples etc ...
Views which collapses embedded resources and even the resource itself can be selected by specifying the `representation` *MIME Type* to `minimal`, `attributes`, `noattributes` or `full` (default).
#### Action (Core)
Complex tasks shouldn't be perform by the client especially if they modify the database. The first reason is *S2* doesn't provide a transaction mechanisem **over** request, .i.e each request in wrapped in a transaction. Providing a such mechanism would be hard to specify at an API level, hard to implement and most of it unnecessary.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
The second reason is, all the business domain has already been written in *Ruby* in *S2* therefore it would be better if any complex task could reuse this business domain instead of rewritting it on the client side in another language. Also, complex task are much easier to write in a *persistence agnostic* way.
*S2* introduces a concept of `Action` which represent a complex task that a user can do. Each actions are exposed via the *API* and can be called easily by the client.

It is strongly recommended that team writting the clients communicate with *S2* team and ask them when needed to add new actions in `lims-laboratory-api` instead of writting complex client/server interaction.
A dedicated server application could also been built on top of *S2* to deal with client specific needs.


### Persistence agnosticism
#### Motivation
*S2* implements its own *ORM* using a *Data Mapper* pattern. The main idea is to decouple totally the business domain from the notion of persistence. Any class of the business domain can work on memory without the need or knowledge of a concept of persistence.
By this, we mean that  things like `plate.load`, `plate.save` or `Plate.create` and even `plate.id` don't make sense in *S2*.
A persistence layer is added on top of it, which is in charge of storing/retrieving a set of objects to/from a specific store. 

Isolating the business domain from the persistence as many benefits. The first is it simplifies the business domain implementation which can focus on implementing the business login in a **ideal word** without having to worry about how objects are persisted. This makes also testing easier, as one can test the business logic without having to setup a persistence context.
There is no direct link between classes and tables. Some tables needed to save an object might not have a corresponding class equivalent in the business domain. There is then no need to **expose** them in the business domain.

For example, the relation between a tube and an aliquot uses an extra *association* table : `tube_aliquots`.
+ A `Tube` represents a physical tube (a labware piece), so it deserve its own class in Business Domain.
+ An `Aliquot` represents the portion of homogeneous content within a container. Example, mixing a blood sample from A and another from blood sample B will
result in a tube containing 2 aliquots : "Blood from A" and "Blood from B", even though in practice we have no way of separating those two samples.
Even though this concept is more abstract than a tube it still has place in the Business Domain.
+ However, `TubeAliquot` which could be the class corresponding to `tube_aliquots` table doesn't exist in the Business Domain. Using the *Data Mapper* pattern we don't need (and don't have) this association class and model
`Tube` has an array of `Aliquot`.

Another benefit is it should allow to change the underlying schema or the  storage type without having to modify the Business Domain.
Let's go back to our previous example. In fact, an aliquot can only be in one tube at the same time so we don't need this extra `tube_aliquots` table. 
We could have just an `tube_id` in the `aliquots` table. We can change this without having to modify anything in the `Tube` or `Aliquot` class. We just need to change the mapping.

For information, an aliquot can belong to something else that a tube , which is why we don't have a `tube_id` in the `aliquots` table.

Another advantage of **persistence-less** Business Domain is it allows **in-memory** object creation which can be used for simulation or optimisation.
For example we can imagine an application which try to optimize some plate layout and need to create plate in memory to do so. With a standard *Active Record* pattern
it might be hard to do so, as there is no guaranty that some methods involved have no side-effect or doesn't access the database.

#### Session
In order to keep the business logic totally separated from the persistence, *S2* uses a `Session` mechanism which allows 'pure' business logic code to be wrapped within a session block whick will take a care
of saving/loaded the corresponding resources. On the other hand , the `Session` mechanism has also been design to prevent as much as possible (or at least make it difficult) for programmer to mix business logic and persistence.
A way to see `Session` is to see it as transaction block where every write to the database  will be executed at the end.
Other benefits of a `Session` beside isolation are:
- True *IdentityMap*  : object are guaranted to be loaded only once, even if it's loaded by 2 different ways.
- Bulk loading : each table is read once.
- Bulk saving : each table is written once.
- Order doesn't matter : the user doesn''t need to worry about resource dependency it in which order resources need to be saved.

Here is some example of common persistence action and there equivalent in *Rails*.

Create | 
*S2*:
`
store.with_session do |session|
	session << Plate.new
end
`
`
plate = Plate.create
`
Save a new object | 
`
plate = Plate.new
store.with_session { |s| s << plate }
`
`
plate = Plate.new
plate.save
`
Load |
`
store.with_session do |session|
	puts session.plate[plate_id]
end
`
`
puts Plate.load(plate_id)
`
Update |
`
store.with_session do |session|
	plate = session.plate[plate_id]
	# Update start there
	plate[:A1] << Aliquot.new
end
`

`
plate = Plate.load(plate_id)
	# Update start there
well = plate.well.create(:A1)
well.aliquot.create
plate.save
`
*Note* The update code in *S2* doesn't need to be executed within a block
and will work perferctly *in memory*.

Delete |
`
store.with_session do |session|
	plate = session.plate[plate_id]
	session.delete plate
end
`
`
Plate.delete(plate_id)
`
*Note* In *S2*, We need to load the plate before loadind it which is unnecessary.
We could implement `Session#delete_for_id` like this :`store.with_session { |s| s.state_for_id(plate_id).mark_for_deletion }`.


#####  Automatic management
Object loaded within a session are automatically **managed** and so, automatically saved if needed
`
store.with_session do |session|
	source_plate = session.plate[source_id]
	target_plate = session.plate[target_id]

	# transfer 50% of the content of source[A1] to target[B12]
	target_plate[:B12] = source_plate[:A1].take(50)
end
`
The code above transfer 50% of the content of a well from a plate to another. Both plates are modifed (the source plate **loses** 50% of its content).
Both plates will be saved without having to specify it.
Once again, once plates have been loaded, the transfer itself is **persistence-agnostic**.

Compare with a *Rails* equivalent :
`
source = Plate.load(source_id)
target = Plate.load(target_id)
target_plate[:B12] = source_plate[:A1].take(50)
source.save
target.save
`
One can argue that the previous block a code could be rewritten so the update is also **persistence-agnosict** like this :
`
def transfer(source, target)
	target_plate[:B12] = source_plate[:A1].take(50)
end

def tranfer!(source_id, target_id)
	source = Plate.load(source_id)
	target = Plate.load(target_id)
	transfer(source, target)
	source.save
	target.save
end
`
The problem with this approach is : it is `transfer` caller responsiblity to know which plates to save whereas only `transfer` knows which plates have been modified.
With *S2* we don't have this problem.

##### Resource id
id of an existing object
`
store.with_session do |session|
	plate = session.plate[plate_id]
	session.plate.id_for(plate).should == plate_id
end
`
`
	plate = Plate.load(plate_id)
	plate.id.should ==  plate_id
`
id of an new object
`
plate_id = store.with_session do |session|
	session << plate=Plate.new
	lambda { session.plate.id_for(plate) }
end.call
`
`
plate = Plate.new
plate_id = plate.save
`

*S2* version it a bit more complicated. We could call `session.plate.id_for(plate)` but this will be called **before** the plate has been saved. Remember, everything is saved **after** the end of the block, therefore
we need to call `id_for` after the end of the session (when it doesn't exist anymore). A lambda capturing the session do the trick.
Please note, that this is rarely needed in real life : the only cases we need this is mainly in specs.

#### Resources can't be moved between session
As the database id of resource is not part of the resource itself  but stored within the session, loading a resource in a session and saved it in another will not work.

For example

`
 # load plate
plate = store.with_session do |session1|
	session1.plate[plate_id]
end

 # update plate
store.with_session do |session2|
	plate[:A1] << Aliquot.new
end
`
Will not save the plate, because `plate` is not managed by `session2`.
Adding it to the session like this ;
`
 # update plate
store.with_session do |session2|
	session2 << plate
	plate[:A1] << Aliquot.new
end
`
will create a new plate instead of updated it. As `session2` doesn't know the id of `plate`, it's not different for it that any other new plate and so will treat it as a new object and create it in the database.


#### Don't create session.
As you might have notice, resources can't be saved or loaded without a `Session` and a session can't be provided without a `Store`. We'll come back to the `Store` later.
One reason we are using the *session pattern* is to avoid multiple saving of the same resource. To so, *S2* is trying to make difficult mixing of business logic and persistence.
As a rule of thumb, code dealing with business object shouldn't create explicitely a `Session` but should be either given one, or better don't need any at all.

Consider the plate transfer example above. A naive way using plate ids as parameters would be.

`
def transfer(source_id, target_id, store)
	store.with_session do |session| do
		source_plate = session.plate[source_id]
		target_plate = session.plate[target_id]

		# transfer 50% of the content of source[A1] to target[B12]
		target_plate[:B12] = source_plate[:A1].take(50)
  end
end
`
The problem with this code is if we were transfering twice from the same plates, let's say like :
`
transfer(source_id, target_id1, store)
transfer(source_id, other_target_id, store)
`

Each transfer load and save the source plate which defeat the objective of `Session`
A better solution would be to pass a `Session` instead of a `Store`.
`
def transfer(source_id, target_id, session)
	source_plate = session.plate[source_id]
	target_plate = session.plate[target_id]

	# transfer 50% of the content of source[A1] to target[B12]
	target_plate[:B12] = source_plate[:A1].take(50)
end
`

The `Session` being created around the two transfers :
`
store.with_session do |session|
	transfer(source_id, target_id , session)
	transfer(source_id, other_target, session)
end
`
The 3 plates are saved at the same time and only once.
However, the `transfer` method is not **persistence-agnostic** and could be rewritten to use plates instead of plate ids.
This way, the previous code becomes :
`
def transfer(source, plate)
	# transfer 50% of the content of source[A1] to target[B12]
end
`
And that's the caller responsibility to transform the id into resources ...
`
store.with_session do |session|
	source, target, other_target = session.plate[source_id, target_id, other_target_id]
	transfer(source, target)
	transfer(source, other_target)
end
`
This is the prefered way : `transfer` is much clearer and easier to test focusing only just transfering, and as a bonus, the 3 plates will be 
bulk loaded and bulk saved.

#### Subsession
Sometimes, however, we don't have the choice  and we need to save some resources before the end of session. To do so a **sub session** can be used.
Example (this is contrieved one) we'll try to create an order and user at the same time and try to add the user id to the order comment.
`
store.with_session do |session|
	session << order = Order.new
	session.with_session do |sub_session|
		sub_session << user = User.new
	end # user saved
	order.comment = "Created by #{session.id_for(user)}"
end # order saved
`
A subsession behave exactly has a normal session, .i.e it will only saved the object it's managing. However a subsesion share the resource cache (`Persistor`) with its
parent. This means that, reloaded a resource managed by the partent session  won't reload the object (but use the cache) and a resource created in a subsession
will be still visible by the parent session (but not managed). `session.id_of(user)` is therefore valid even though `session` is not managing `user`.
Modifications made to  `user` within the parent  session will not be saved (except of course, if `user` is *added* to the session via `session << user` (which is valid in that case).

## Implementation Details
### Resources
In order to be **mapped** easily, objects needs a common interface to be converted to and from a Hash, which is the purpose of the `Lims::Core::Resource` mixin.
A resource is an object which can be stored/retrieved in a store and encoded into JSON.
Resources uses `Virtus` to facilitate this conversion between object an Hash.
`Virtus` allows us to describe the attributes of a class and convert it automaticaly to from a hash through `initialize` and `attributes`.

For example, a *sample* is *S2* has a name. The `Sample` class is defined as follow :


`
class Sample
	include Lims::Core::Resource # a sample is a resource
  attribute :name, String # and has a name.
end
`

You can then create a new sample from Hash :
`
sample = Sample.new(:name => 'sample 1')
`
access its' name
`
puts sample.name # => 'sample 1'
`
convert it to an hash :
`
puts sample.attributes # =>  {:name => 'sample 1' }
`

In practice, `Virtus#attributes` is slow, so to speed it up, we redefine the attributes method as follow.
`
def attributes
	{:name => @name }
end
`
The problem of this approach is, the `attributes` method needs to be updated when a new attribute is added to the class and it's bypassing the default value mecanism. Default values in *Virtus* are not set at initialization but the first time an accessor is called (which is probably why bypassing the accessor and using `@name` is faster).
### Persistence Layer
The persistence layer is organized around 3 classes : `Store`, `Session` and `Persistor`. `Store` represents the database : it only holds the connection parameters and can supply `Session`.
The database can't be access directly via the `Store` but need to be accessed within a session block through a `Session` object. A `Session` correspond to a user session or transaction. 
All objects modified within the session will be **synchronised** with the database at the end of the session. The session object itself can be seen as a handler to the current connection.

A `Session` has two main roles , manage objects (via `<<`) and give access to `Persistor` which are the core of persistence implementations.
#### Persistors
A `Persistor` corresponds to a resource class, and in the case of a *SQL* `Store` to a table. It defines and implements the mapping between a resource and the database.
A `Persistor` also implement an `indentity map` of object, i.e. a cache of all loaded objects and their id. An object loaded via different path (example by id or by criteria) , will be only loaded once.

##### Persistor specialization
In order to find the persistor corresponding to a resource, the persistor class and the resource class needs to be **linked** somehow. This is done by convention : the persistor class should be declared within the resource class.
If many persistors are declared within the same class, the session will try to find first a persistor **corresponding to the same type** of session and if not, find a persistor corresponding to the super class of the session and generate a persistor class including the persistor mixin corresponding to the session.
This allow persistor to inherits automatically from the resource class and the session type.

Example : *SQL* persistor of a plate.
`Lims::Core::Persistence` provides two persistors mixin, the base one `Lims::Core::Persistence::Persistor` and a *Sequel* one `Lims::Core::Persistence`.

It's a good practice to implement a main persistor which defines all methods as a **pattern** using methods from `Lims::Core::Persistence::Persistor` or overriden by its own speciliazation.

The persistor needs to be define in the `Plate` class, so:

`
# plate/persistor.rb
class Plate
	class Persistor < Lims::Core::Persistor
		def load_children(states)
			@session.aliquots.find_by(:id => states.map(&:id))
		end
	end

# plate/sequel_persistor.rb
class Plate
  class SequelPersistor  < Persistor
			include  Lims::Core::Persistince::Sequel::Persistor
	end
end
`
First remark, the name of the persistor class doesn't matter. Then, `load_children` take many **states** as argument. A `ResourceState` is a sort of resource proxy (including the database id). We need more because to be able to do bulk loading, all persistor methods are defined for a set of resources.

When looking for a persistor class for `Plate` a `Persistence::Session` will find `Plate::Persistor`, whereas a `Persistence::Sequel::Session` will find `Plate::SequelPersistor`.
If `Plate::SequelPersistor` wasn't defined, it will be automatically generated (including `Sequel::Persistor`).

#### Dirty attributes
Resources are not updated in the database if they haven't been modified. To do so, *S2* uses a **dirty attributes** mechanism. A **dirty key** is calculated once a resource is loaded and before being saved. If the two keys are identical, then we assume the object hasn't been modified and we don't save it.
